This week the team has been heads down shipping a ton of incremental improvements. We've shipped resumable streams for better connection handling, a bundling overhaul for improved monorepo support, and cleaned up a ton more.

We also sold out all our [tsconf.ai](http://tsconf.ai) early bird tickets.

**Release:** `@mastra/core@0.17.0`

## Resumable Streams

We've added support for resumable streams, allowing stream operations to be automatically retried if the connection is lost. The new server cache primitives enable streams to resume from where they left off rather than starting over, significantly improving user experience during connection issues. 

The resumable stream flow works as follows: clients start streaming normally, the server caches each chunk, if connection is lost, clients can call `stream()` with the `runId` to get a TransformStream that first replays all cached chunks then pipes the live stream. 

See [PR #7949](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/7949) for more details.
