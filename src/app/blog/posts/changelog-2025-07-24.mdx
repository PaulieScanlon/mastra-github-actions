Another big week for Mastra! We're thrilled to announce Mastra Templates and our second hackathon, plus major improvements to Memory, Evals, and more.

Let's dive in:

## Introducing Mastra Templates

Bootstrap your AI projects instantly with pre-built starting points for common agentic use cases.

```bash
npx mastra@latest create --template [template-name]
```

Browse our templates library featuring ready-to-use projects for:

- PDF chatbots
- Text-to-SQL
- Browser agents
- CSV analysis
- Docs chatbots
- And more

Skip the boilerplate and get straight to building.

## MASTRA.BUILD Templates Hackathon

Our second virtual hackathon is focused entirely on building Mastra Templates! It's your turn to build the best templates and win prizes.

Join us from **July 28 - August 11** for:

- Cash prizes
- Feature slots in our templates library
- Judges from Chroma, Arcade, WorkOS, Smithery, Browserbase, and Recall

Kickoff ceremony will be livestreamed Monday, July 28th at noon PT.

Register at [https://mastra.build](https://mastra.build).

## StreamVNext Protocol

We've shipped a new unified streaming protocol that enables nested streaming and usage tracking for all Mastra primitives — agents, tools, and workflows.

This major improvement provides:

- Unified streaming across all components
- Support for nested streaming operations
- Built-in token usage tracking and monitoring

## Complete Eval Scores System

We've shipped a new evals infrastructure with code and LLM-based scoring capabilities. This comprehensive system includes:

- **Scorer interface** with abstract methods for custom implementations
- **Code-based scoring** for deterministic evaluations
- **LLM-based scoring** for subjective assessments
- **Scorer hooks** that can be triggered for agents and workflows
- **Storage support** across all major databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, LanceDB, ClickHouse, LibSQL)

Now you can properly evaluate and benchmark your agents' performance across different scenarios with both objective and subjective metrics.

## Memory Improvements

### New MSSQL Provider

Microsoft SQL Server is now supported as a backend for memory storage, complete with implementation and tests. This expands your options for enterprise deployments.

### Enhanced MongoDB Performance

We've improved query performance by pre-filtering on properties before vector search and fixed multi-property filter bugs. Your MongoDB-backed agents should see noticeable speed improvements.

### Memory in Playground

Memory features are now available in the playground with semantic recall and configurable options. Test and develop memory-enabled agents directly in the UI — no more guessing what your agent remembers.

### Runtime Context Configuration

Memory can now be configured using runtime context, making it easier to dynamically adjust memory settings based on your application's needs.

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Auth Improvements

The dev playground now bypasses authentication for local development when auth is enabled. This makes testing much easier — no more juggling tokens during development!


That's all for this week! We're especially excited about Templates and the new StreamVNext protocol — they represent major steps forward in making Mastra more powerful and easier to use.
