We shipped a new model router! Use 600+ models from 45 providers with a single API. Plus automatic model fallbacks to keep your apps running when providers have issues.

**Release:** `@mastra/core@0.20.0`

## Model Router & Automatic Fallbacks

### Model Router

We've built a model router that gives you access to 600+ models from 45 providers through simple magic strings. No need to import provider-specific packages or dealing with different SDKs. Just use the `"provider/model"` pattern and Mastra handles the rest.

```jsx
// Use any model with a simple string
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "MyAgent",
  model: "anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku"  // Or "openai/gpt-4o", "google/gemini-pro", etc.
});

```

The router automatically detects API keys from environment variables and provides full TypeScript autocomplete for every model directly in your editor. The playground now includes a searchable model picker that also shows provider connection status and links to documentation.

See [PR #8235](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/8235) and [PR #8332](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/8332) for implementation.

### Automatic Model Fallbacks

Define fallback chains to ensure your applications stay online even when providers experience issues. If one model fails, Mastra automatically switches to the next one in your list.

```jsx
// Define fallback chains for reliability
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "MyAgent",
  model: ["anthropic/claude-3-opus", "openai/gpt-4o", "google/gemini-pro"]
});

```

The playground displays which model from your fallback list was successfully used, giving you full visibility into your model routing.

See [PR #7427](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/7427) and [PR #8167](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/8167) for implementation.

## New Streaming Architecture is Now Default

Our battle-tested `streamVNext` and `generateVNext` functions are now the standard `stream` and `generate`. This is a breaking change. If you're already using vNext functions, migration is trivial—just rename them. For those on original functions, Legacy variants preserve the old behavior.

See our [full announcement](https://mastra.ai/blog/mastra-streaming) for the complete story behind this.
