Welcome to Mastra Changelog #3. Let's dive in.

## Major Updates

### New `mastra build` command

We've released a new `mastra build` command.

This command lets you bundle a production version of your Mastra agents and workflows into a Hono server.

This is good for deploying Mastra on a cloud server or containerized environment (ie, EC2, Digital Ocean, etc).

### Evals added to Dev Playground

The big news here is that we've added evals to the dev playground.

This means you can now test your agents and workflows locally and get feedback on their performance.

Metrics can be accessed both during CI and in live environments through the playground.

Here's a screenshot:

## More Dev Playground improvements

The local dev playground is now more powerful and easier to use:

- Migrated to Hono server for better performance
- Enhanced OpenAPI documentation
- Added Swagger UI support
- Automatic rebuild/refresh on file changes

Some build and performance improvements here too:

- Separated playground dependencies from CLI package
- Improved build & deploy configurations
- Enhanced tsconfig setup

These changes make the development experience more responsive and reliable.

### More Evals

Building on our recently released `@mastra/evals` framework, we've added new eval metrics:

- Bias detection
- Hallucination measurement
- Contextual relevance
- Summarization quality

In addition, we've reorganized metrics into NLP and LLM categories for better organization, and metrics now return a standardized format with `score` and `info` object containing detailed information.

### New Model Support

Added support for:

- Perplexity Sonar model
- o1 model support
- DeepSeek-v3 and DeepSeek-r1 model support
- PlayAI TTS with streaming

### New `@mastra/deployer` package

We've released a new `@mastra/deployer` package to streamline deployment workflows.

The package handles deploying Mastra into a serverless environment (ie, bundling and code splitting appropriately), managing secrets, and writing files.

Because we've abstracted it out into a package, other providers can extend it. If you're interested in adding support for another provider, take a look at the [@mastra/deployer](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/packages/deployer) package and the individual provider code: [Cloudflare](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/deployers/cloudflare), [Vercel](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/deployers/vercel), and [Netlify](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/deployers/netlify).

## Mastra Memory (coming soon)

We're finalizing a number of advanced memory features:

- Hierarchical memory storage
- Long-term memory via memory compression
- Vector search memory

The code is currently in a draft PR on a branch: [https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/1525](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/1525)
