## vNext Workflows is fully launched 🎉

We officially switched over to vNext on May 6th, 2025. That means importing from **`@mastra/core/workflows`** will give you the **`vNext`** workflows.

If you’re using the legacy workflow system, and you want to upgrade Mastra versions but you’re not yet ready to switch over, you can use the **`legacy`** import and prefix, eg:

```tsx
import { Step, Workflow } from '@mastra/core/workflows/legacy'
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core/mastra'
const step1 = new Step(...)
const workflow = new Workflow(...).step(step1).commit();

const mastra = new Mastra({
  // registering legacy workflows
  legacy_workflows: {
    myWorkflow: workflow
  }
})

// accessing the workflow through the mastra class:
mastra.legacy_getWorkflow('myWorkflow')
```

## AGUI integration

Mastra now works with AGUI clients. You can stream messages, trigger tool calls, and manage agents using a new adapter layer.

This makes it straightforward to plug Mastra agents into AGUI-powered frontends.

**What's new:**

- Added an `AGUIAdapter` class for handling message streaming and tool invocations.

- New `getAGUI()` helper for managing adapters.

- Tests added for UUID generation and AGUI message conversion.

## New: Comprehensive Linting for Mastra CLI

We’ve added a robust linting system to the Mastra CLI to help you catch configuration and dependency issues before they become problems.

The new linter includes rules for validating project setups and dependencies across different deployment platforms, making it easier to maintain healthy, production-ready projects.

That’s all for now. Find the full release notes [here](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/releases).

Happy building 🚀
