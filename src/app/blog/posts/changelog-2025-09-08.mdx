This week we're thrilled to announce support for Zod v4 while maintaining full compatibility with Zod v3! Plus, we've revamped observability under **ai-tracing**, shipped improvements to our AI SDK v5 integration, and enhanced our CLI.

**Release:** `@mastra/core@0.16.0`

## Zod v4 support

We've successfully added support for Zod v4 while maintaining backward compatibility with Zod v3. The upgrade enables you to use either Zod v3 or v4 in your projects seamlessly. We've updated our internal schema handling to use `toJsonSchema` from Zod and upgraded autoform (used in the developer playground) to v4 for improved TypeScript generics and type safety.

This is not a breaking change; your existing Zod v3 schemas will continue to work perfectly alongside newer v4 schemas. See [PR #6942](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/6942) for implementation details.
