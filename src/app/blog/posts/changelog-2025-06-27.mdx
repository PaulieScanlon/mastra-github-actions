Another busy week at Mastra. We're thrilled to announce the public beta of Mastra Cloud, plus some exciting new features that make building AI agents and workflows even more powerful.

Let's dive into this week's updates.

## Mastra Cloud

We're opening up **Mastra Cloud** to everyone—no waitlist, no invite, just head to [mastra.ai/cloud](https://mastra.ai/cloud) and start building.

With Mastra Cloud, you can:

- Deploy and manage agents, workflows, MCP servers, and tools.
- Test in playground
- Monitor, observe, and debug your runs in real time.

Sign up and deploy your first agent in minutes at [mastra.ai/cloud](https://mastra.ai/cloud).


## Agent Network

You can now chat with your agent network in playground — great for complex tasks like "research London AND write an article about its weather".

We currently have two chat modes: `loop` and `stream`.

Loop lets your agent network keep iterating for a specified number of execution steps. You can tweak the max iterations directly in Playground.

## Memory

Last week we added per-resource semantic recall. This week, we added per-resource working memory across multiple Mastra packages.

This enables persistent user memory across multiple conversation threads. We've also included flexible scoping options.

## Workflows

We added a new `bail` function to workflows. This method allows workflows to exit a step early.

It also updates the return types of `suspend()` and `bail()` to `any` so that their value can still be returned (without having to return something that looks like the step result type).

We also introduced a new async operation `createRunAsync()` that also stores a `pending` workflow state into storage. As such, the `createRun` method is deprecated and will `logger.warn()`.

## Mastra 101

We added a new lesson to [Mastra 101](https://mastra.ai/course), our mcp-based course that you can take directly in your IDE (like Cursor or Windsurf).

This fourth lesson teaches you how to build powerful workflows that orchestrate multiple AI agents and tools.



That's it for this week! As always, we'd love to hear your feedback and see what you're building with Mastra.

Happy building! And remember: you can just deploy things. 🚀
