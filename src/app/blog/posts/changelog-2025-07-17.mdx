Big news this week! We've achieved state-of-the-art performance on the LongMemEval benchmark with our memory improvements, reaching 80% accuracy. Plus, we're shipping new CLI templates, reasoning display in the playground, and major improvements across the board.

Let's dive in:

## Memory: State-of-the-art LongMemEval Performance

We implemented the [LongMemEval benchmark](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval) and achieved **80% accuracy** — outperforming other specialized memory solutions. This breakthrough came entirely from improvements to semantic recall.

### Improved Semantic Recall for SOTA Performance

We restructured how recalled messages are presented to LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results:

- Messages are now grouped by date with clear time labels
- Better distinction between current and past conversations
- Improved formatting that includes contextual thread information

These changes alone brought us to 80% accuracy on LongMemEval — proving that RAG absolutely works for agent memory when implemented correctly. [Read our deep dive on using RAG for agent memory](https://mastra.ai/blog/use-rag-for-agent-memory).

### vNext Working Memory Updates

As a bonus improvement from our research, we've shipped an experimental 'vNext' version of working memory with smarter update logic:

```tsx
// Enable the improved memory tool
const memory = new Memory({
  provider: myProvider,
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      template: `Track user preferences and key details`,
      version: "vnext", // Available now!
    },
  },
});
```

The new API prevents accidental memory erasure during long conversations. Instead of wholesale replacements, agents now provide update reasons and can make targeted changes — a nice quality-of-life improvement for working memory users.

## CLI & Playground: Major Usability Upgrades

### Reasoning Display

The playground now shows agent reasoning in real-time. Watch your agents think through problems step-by-step as they work — invaluable for debugging and understanding agent behavior.

### Working Memory Improvements

You can now view and edit working memory directly in the playground while interacting with agents. No more guessing what your agent remembers — see it and modify it live.

We also added support for passing JSON schemas to working memory.

### CLI Templates

We've improved the CLI with better template support in the `create-mastra` command. These templates provide pre-configured starting points for common use cases, complete with example agents, tools, and workflows tailored to specific scenarios. Create templates with:

```bash
npx mastra@latest create --template
```

When you run `create-mastra`, you can now choose from different setups that include the right dependencies and boilerplate code for your project type. This makes it even faster to get started with Mastra.

**Coming soon**: We're working on a library of ready-to-use Mastra templates for specific use cases. Stay tuned for the next release!

## Other Important Updates

### Networks

- Agent networks now properly handle runtime context across all components
- Fixed thread creation bugs in network `stream`, `generate`, and `loopStream` functions
- Networks correctly route to vNext AgentNetwork instead of legacy versions

### Workflows

- Added runtime context persistence in workflow snapshots — workflows retain context after resuming from suspension
- Fixed nested workflow execution within loops
- Workflow status correctly reflects completion state

### Deployer

- Support for private packages as external dependencies
- Toggle for installDependencies in Cloudflare deployer

### Voice

- OpenAI Realtime Voice now properly handles error responses from OpenAI

### RAG

- Removed cohere-ai dependency in favor of direct fetch calls
- Fixed semantic recall system message formatting to include dates, times, and thread information

That's all for this week! We're especially excited about the memory improvements — 80% on LongMemEval proves that RAG absolutely works for agent memory when done right.

Happy building! 🚀
