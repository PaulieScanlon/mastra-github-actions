Last week, we shipped the first MCP registry registry, added model settings in Playground UI, and published some new docs. Let’s dig in…

## The MCP registry registry (and mcp server)

We launched the very first [MCP registry registry](https://mastra.ai/mcp-registry-registry), which is exactly what it sounds like it is: a registry of the most popular MCP registries.

Since searching within two nested lists can be difficult, we also shipped an MCP registry registry MCP server.  Just `npm install @mastra/mcp-registry-registry` to start asking questions and explore how to use MCP with Mastra Agents.

## Model settings in Playground UI

We enabled model setting controls in Mastra local dev. This means you can directly adjust [model settings like temperature, max tokens, and max retries](https://mastra.ai/docs/local-dev/mastra-dev#model-settings) when chatting with agents — and learn which settings work best.

## New Memory docs section

We shipped [new documentation on how Memory works](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/overview) in Mastra.  You’ll find core definitions, installation instructions, and all sorts of tools and ideas for customizing memory configurations, e.g.:


*In Mastra, context is broken up into three parts: system instructions and information about the user ([working memory](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/working-memory)), recent messages ([message history](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/overview#conversation-history)), and older messages that are relevant to the user's query ([semantic recall](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/semantic-recall)).*

*In addition, we provide [memory processors](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/memory-processors) to trim context or remove information if the context is too long.*


That&apos;s all for recent major Mastra updates. [Find the full release log here](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/releases/tag/%40mastra%2Fcore%400.8.3). And, as usual, stay tuned for more changes next time…

Happy building 🚀
