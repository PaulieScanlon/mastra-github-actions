Welcome to the Mastra Changelog.

We’ll be publishing these every week, but since this is our first one, we’re covering ground from the last two weeks.

Let's dive in.

## Suspend/resume in workflows

We’ve made it easier to build checkpoints, human-in-the-loop intervention, and/or monitoring into any of your workflows. You can simply call `suspend` inside any step (or between steps) in a workflow and `resume` it later.

State is stored in the Postgres DB in the mastra engine.

The mental model here is to think about `suspend` as an exception you're throwing, where the workflow will handle catching that exception and persisting state.

## `mastra create` for new projects

You can now build projects in a standalone way using `npm create mastra`.

This will create a new project scaffold with directories and (if you want) examples. We've found this to be a cleaner DX for new users.

While you can still initialize within an existing project (`mastra init`), `create` generates a ready-to-use project scaffold—complete with recommended directories, configuration, and boilerplate.

## `mastra dev` for an interactive local dev server

Here's Shane Thomas demoing Mastra Dev, a local development server for Mastra projects that helps you see and interact with all the agents, workflows, and tools within your Mastra application.

It includes:

- an agents playground so you can chat with your agents
- `/text` and `/generate` endpoints for each of your agents so you can test them via `curl` or call them over the network
- visual workflow diagrams for each workflow
- endpoints for each of your workflows so you can test them via `curl` or call them over the network
- a registry of all of your tools

`mastra dev` makes it easier to build, understand, and debug your agents and workflows.

## Mastra Examples: basic building blocks for anyone to get started

![Mastra Examples](/2025-01-10-examples.gif)

To make it easy for anyone to start building projects with Mastra, we released a collection of short examples of all the basic AI engineering Mastra primitives: things like generating and streaming text, describing images, calling a workflow, chunking text, and even implementing basic RAG (retrieval-automated generation) systems.

Each example links to a subdirectory of a Github repo, so you can `npm install` and run them locally.

## API endpoint improvements

Previously, Mastra offered a single "generate" API for text responses with two flags for structured output and streaming.

We realized having four combinations of flags was confusing, so we've split `generate` into two separate APIs: `generate` and `stream`, each with a flag for structured output.
